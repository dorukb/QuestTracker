# QuestTracker
A small and fun app to keep track of one's homework, errands, projects etc. woven with fantasy elements!

"Quest" is a sugar coated word for stuff you have to do :)

I am developing this for my own use to keep track of stuff during a semester.

This version has:
Add and remove quests, A quests has a name, a description and time left to finish.,
Persistance of quests between sessions,
Scrollable quest display area,
Detail view for each quest.


Planned features:
Edit quest name&description after addition.
Mark quests as complete.
Separate tabs for different quest types: Main, Side, Misc., Completed.
Sound FX for UI interactions.
Android & iOS support.
Simulate the time counter more precisely, currently just days.
